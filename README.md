A very simple addon which remembers your recent LFD buddies and shows
them when asked to (with /trooper show) alongside a handy clickable link
to ignore whomever gets on your nerves.

Recent interactions are not saved between sessions or even reloads. This
addon was designed to allow me to ignore people who never spoke up in
chat and left before I could ignore them via Unitframe click.
